I create projects based on whatever comes to mind and share them on GitHub.

## About Me

- I love experimenting with new ideas and turning them into code.  
- Currently learning nothing in particular (but I do work with React and Python).  
- Goal: Build projects that are fun, useful, or just plain weird.  
- Fueled by curiosity (and probably too much coffee).
